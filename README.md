# AFrame3D
A method to convert an image to a 3D model in VR

A-Frame VR(3D model of a 2D Image)
A-frame is a really nice and easy to use web framework for creating VR and AR experiences. In this tutorial, we would use Python and A-frame to create a 3D model from a 2D image.
The input would be an image like this:

<img src="https://github.com/jojo96/AFrame3D/blob/main/1.png" width=99% height=600 alt="Normal"> 

Using this image, we will create a 3D model that can be viewed in webVR. The result:

<img src="https://github.com/jojo96/AFrame3D/blob/main/2.png" width=49% height=600 alt="Normal">

We can also animate this:

The same method can be used to create pixel art in AFrame. An example:
